# Major Project Proposal

## Description
Metro builder game. It will be a map of a city, divided up into sections, each with their own level of demand, which will change throughout. Users task is to build a metro for the city using a limited amount of money, with the satisfaction of each quadrant contributing to the overall satisfaction with the system and also the amount of income the player has to build new extensions + stations. You will be able to place stations where you want, give them names, and make lines connecting them. Satisfaction in each quadrant will be based on how many other stations people there have access to through the metro, as well as how many lines make a stop in that quadrant.

## Need to have list
  - pop up menu with options to place new stations, extend lines
  - stats bar at the top showing the amount of money, overall satisfaction
  - regionalized stats pages that pop up when the mouse is hovering on the desired quadrant, showing satisfaction, demand
  - ~~same thing for stations, except displaying the name of the stations only~~
  *realized I couldn't do this realistically. The amount of stations that you need tyo place is too high to bother putting names for them. This also interferes with the stats pages of the sectors*

## Nice to have list
  - animations(sqaure moving back and forth on built lines)
  - having a station icon that follows the mouse when you have selected to place one down.
  - home/starting screen
