# Reflection:
The hardest thing about this project was to make the sectors register changes in their satisfaction.
I solved it by assigning a lineCount and StationCount variable as part of the sectors.
If I were to do this project again, I think I would have attempted something different entirely. In the end,. my game is not nearly as fun to play as many of my classmates. So i think I would have attempted to make something more exciting and that doesn't take as long.
I did not complete my enitre need. o have list. As you can see in my proposal, one item on the list was not possible/I didn't have enough time left to do it.
